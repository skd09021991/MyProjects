/*
The react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app and it renders the App component which is App.js 
and App.js contains the jsx . The Document method getElementById() returns an Element object representing the element whose id property matches the
 specified string. 
Since element IDs are required to be unique if specified, they're a useful way to get access to a specific element quickly.

There are many things which is imported like React class , ReactDom class and other components from the src.
